# Timed-Coding-Quiz

## Description

I developed the coding quiz for several reasons. Initially, my aim was to find an engaging method to review my coding knowledge. Additionally, I aimed to challenge myself by integrating my accumulated CSS, HTML, and JavaScript skills into a single project. This endeavor marked my initial independent project, allowing me to enhance my understanding of various concepts. Throughout this process, I gained insights into utilizing arrays for storing and retrieving information, implementing event listeners, crafting buttons, CSS styling for buttons, modifying messages using JavaScript, incorporating HTML elements into JavaScript for styling purposes, preserving user input, and most importantly, the significance of commencing with HTML and CSS styling prior to embarking on JavaScript development. It's worth noting that starting with JavaScript had unintended consequences, leading to more limitations in styling and unforeseen issues compared to the alternative approach.
